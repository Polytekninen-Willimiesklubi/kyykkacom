# Stores

Pinia is state management system to share and store states. Store information about website or API calls to pinia store and call them as needed from basically anywhere 

From developer point of view although this is wasy wrapper to API calls once configure properly: No need to know the spesific url, because it's already handled through store.
I have also put headers from tables into `headers.js` to clean the .vue-files from the static data that is lying around.
