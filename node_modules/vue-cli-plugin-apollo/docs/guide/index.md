# Usage

::: warning
This plugin is intended to be used in a project created with Vue CLI 3.

Add the plugin to the project:

vue add apollo
```

::: tip
An example `ApolloExample.vue` component alongside some GraphQL query files will be added into your sources if you chose to include the examples.
:::

Start your app:

npm run serve
```

[Recommended VS Code extension](https://github.com/prismagraphql/vscode-graphql)

**Updating `vue-cli-plugin-apollo` will also update both Apollo Client and its configuration for you! :+1:**
